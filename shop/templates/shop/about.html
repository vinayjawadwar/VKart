            <h5>Vkart Private Limited, Vkart is an Indian e-commerce company based in Bengaluru, India.
                It was founded by Vinay Jawadwar and Kapil Mathpati in 2020. The company initially focused on Handicraft sales, before expanding
                into other product categories such as Art, fashion, wooden works and lifestyle products.
                The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary,
                and the domestic rival Snapdeal. As of March 2020, Vkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce
                industry.
                Vkart is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its
                acquisitions of Myntra and Jabong.com), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the
                sale of electronics and mobile phones.
                Vkart also owns Paytm, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).
